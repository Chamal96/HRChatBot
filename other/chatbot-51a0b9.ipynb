Maybe 25.', 'Which holiday was that?', 'I think it was Australia', 'Do you still talk to the people you met?', \"Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\", 'Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?', 'what do you mean?', 'I think it\\'s like a 6th sense, often seen as \"cold readings\" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.', \"Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky\", 'There\\'s this practice called \"Treasure Hunting\" that\\'s kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There\\'s a book called \"The Ultimate Treasure Hunt\" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.', 'So, do you do treasure hunting often?', \"I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.\", 'Hi', 'Any plans for the weekend?', 'my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!', \"That's great!

What's up???\", 'Nothing much, how you doin?', \"I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\", 'Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?', 'The last time in New York, back in June.', \"Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\", \"Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\", 'Oh really?

My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!', 'What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?', 'Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?', \"I'd love to try! Can we schedule something for next week?\", 'Sure! What does your Saturday look like?', 'Saturday looks pretty good, shall we shoot for something in the morning?', 'Hi!', 'hey', 'is it raining pretty bad today?', 'yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options', \"surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\", \"yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here ðŸ˜›\", 'Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...', \"yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\", \"Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\", 'yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here', 'people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area', \"it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\", 'hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?', 'nope, what does it say?', 'they were talking about how AI is helping climate change.

I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.\", \"So what's your outlook? Something blue?\", \"Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor.

I really enjoy the Avenger movies', \"it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature\", 'That sounds really cool! I think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good!', 'yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?', 'I enjoy baking cookies. I am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie ðŸ™‚ What about you?', 'I enjoy eating ðŸ™‚', 'so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie', 'I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?', 'thanks! I generally love noodle soups like Pho or Ramen :)', 'Noodle soup is delicious!

Even though I bake, I cannot cook', 'seems like we share a thing in common, yay!', 'Hi!', 'Good afternoon!', 'How has your week been?', 'So far so good. It is holiday season. So just chilling', \"I think I'm getting sick with a cold ðŸ˜ž So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.\", 'lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?', \"Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.\", 'ðŸ˜‚', 'Do you have big plans?', 'Yes! I am going to Hawaii! This will be my first time visiting Hawaii. Really excited about it.', \"I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.\", 'lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.', \"Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.\", 'ðŸ˜‚', 'Hi!', \"Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\", 'Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?', 'Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?', \"Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\", 'Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.', \"Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\", \"I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\", \"Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\", 'Are you doing any home decorating then?', 'Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.', \"I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\", 'Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.', 'I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?', 'Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.', \"I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\", 'Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.', \"Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.\", 'Great, I hope you find a nice tree.', 'Hi!', 'Hey', \"How's your day going?\", 'pretty good. yours?', \"Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..\", 'oh what happened?', \"Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')\", 'hahah wait for real?', 'I know right! Are you taking History next semester?', \"No I'm not in school anymore\", 'Oh I see. What do you do?', 'I train and compete in horse vaulting', 'Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?', \"lol you're too funny\", 'Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?', 'Yeah, but I part time work on a farm.

Why do you ask?\", \"I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\", 'Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?', \"Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\", 'Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?', 'The gerbera. It\\'s like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.', 'Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.', 'Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did.

Did you make any progress?\", \"I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\", \"Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\", 'Ah, good thought, thanks!', \"Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\", \"Now that is a good idea.

I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?\", \"I'd say that I want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime.

Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?', 'I grew up in the United States, but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money, so we moved to Taiwan to live with family for a little bit.', 'ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?', \"I was kind of too young to really understand, but apparently there are people who scam Asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business. I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental.

What's your favourite game?\", \"I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\", \"What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\", \"well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table.\", 'Wow! A cage match!

How did you come up with this idea?', \"We created a scholarship for leaders from <REDACTED_TERM> to visit an international institute at <REDACTED_TERM> for which there was no African representation.
